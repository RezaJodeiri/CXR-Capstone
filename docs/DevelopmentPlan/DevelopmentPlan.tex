\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}


\section{Team Communication Plan}

Neuralanalyzers plans to hold in person and virutual meetings as a method of communication between the team. 

\subsection{Discord}
Discord will be used as the team's main mehtod of communication as its great at message logging, file sharing, creating threads for issues, real time communication and creating channels to separate information. Discord will be used by team members to update, and send key information or documentation links such as GitHub links, YouTube links, and code blocks to help keep the team up to date as well as ensure note taking is kept at a high standard. 
\subsection{GitHub}
GitHub is a great resource that Neuralanalyzers will be utilizing to create branchs and track code whilst ensuring clean merging of code between members. On github, issue requests can be created for the team to be notified and add input, to fix following issues as well as update the project as a whole. This will be the key center point where all the documentation and code will be saved. 

\section{Team Member Roles}

\begin{itemize}
\item Nathan Luong
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Scrum Master
        \item Developer

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
  
\section{Workflow Plan}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Usage of Git, Github
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The capstone repository (https://github.com/RezaJodeiri/CXR-Capstone) will be actively maintained by all 5 members.
    \item Many Core Github features will be used extensively in order to drive our capstone project.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Github Issues}: to track Issues, Tickets, Bugs, and Tasks
      \item \textbf{Github Repository}: to monitor, and track changes, and store source code of the capstone project.
      \item \textbf{Github Actions}: to run automation for continuous integration tasks. For example: Unit tests or linting check per pull requests.
      \item \textbf{Github Branch Protection}: to protect developers from accidental code push onto main branch.
      \item \textbf{Github Approval Rules}: to make sure that changes are approved by all 4 other team members, before being merged into main.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \item Pull Requests
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All Pull Requests will come with a template. This template can be found under \textbf{.github/pull_request_template.md} 
    \item On every pull requests, members are required to provide detail descriptions, and checklist, ensuring standardized code-review process.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Branching Strategy
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Branching Strategy might differ from case-to-case. However, general development guideline will encourage members to follow a trunk-based development approach.
    \item Each members will be responsible to keep their local repos up-to-date with the remote repo, then each member will work on the ticket/issue/task, and open a pull request against the main branch.
    \item The branch name should be descriptive of the change that being developed. For example: \textbf{dev_plan_MEMBER_NAME} or \textbf{feature/training-data-labelling}

  \end{itemize}
	
	\item Issues/ Tickets Tracking & Management
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
  \end{itemize}

  \item Usage of CI/CD
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\begin{itemize}
    \item How will you be using GitHub projects? 
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We will be using GitHub projects to keep track of the progress of the project. We will create a project board with columns such as To Do, In Progress, and Done. Each task will be represented as an issue on the project board. The project board will be updated regularly to reflect the current status of the project.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Include a link to your GitHub project 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \url{https://github.com/RezaJodeiri/CXR-Capstone}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

TODO

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}


\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It is crucial to create a development plan prior to starting the project as it aims to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget. The development plan outlines the tasks that need to be completed, the resources that are required, and the timeline for completion. By creating a development plan, the team can identify potential risks and issues early on and develop strategies to mitigate them. The development plan also helps to ensure that all team members are on the same page and working towards the same goals.
    \end{itemize}
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD? \\ \\
    % \begin{itemize}
        Advantages of using CI/CD include:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Improved code quality: CI/CD runs automated tests on the code to identify bugs and issues early on, which can help to improve the overall quality of the code.
        \item Faster Development: By using CI/CD we can encourage/create faster development cycles that automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code, which can help to speed up the development process.
        \item Reduced Human Error: By making the deployment process automated, the chance manual errors when deploying is significantly reduced, ensuring reliability and consistency in releases.
        \end{itemize}
    % \end{itemize}
    \item What disagreements did your group have in this deliverable, if any,
    and how did you resolve them?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our group did not have any disagreements in this deliverable.
    \end{itemize}
