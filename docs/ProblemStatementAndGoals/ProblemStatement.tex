\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.} 

\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required
information.}

\subsection{Problem}

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}
1. Physicians \\
Physicians are experts in interpreting X-ray images and their background knowledge can help validate the AI model's accuracy. They will be the primary users of the application as it would help them enhance efficiency and reduce error in analysing chest X-ray images. \\
\\
2. Patients\\
Patients are the end-users of the AI model as they undergo X-ray examinations.They can upload the X-ray by themselves as well to the application for self-diagnosing purposes. This would provide patients with fast and high-accuaracy diagnoses which ensures that they get timely treatment, improving their health outcome.\\
\\
3. Healthcare provider\\
This refers to  hospitals, clinics, and other medical facilities that will implement the AI model. Adapting this AI model to their system will provide a more streamlined workflow, providing patients a better experience and ease the work for physicians. \\
\\
4. Technical support\\
This refers to people who provide maintenance and suppport for the application throughout its lifespan, ensuring a smooth user experience and integration into existing systems.
\\
\subsection{Environment}
This software will be compatible with Windows 10 or higher and macOS 12 or higher. Compatibiity with other version of Windows, macOS is likely but will not be guaranteed nor tested.\\

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
