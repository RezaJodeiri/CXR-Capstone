\section{Symbols, Abbreviations, and Acronyms}
This section records information for easy reference and aims to reduce ambiguity in understanding key concepts used in the project.

\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document, SI (Système International d'Unités) is employed as the unit system. In addition to basic units, several derived units are used as described below. For each unit, the symbol is given, followed by a description of the unit and the SI name.

\subsection{Definitions}
This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent sections and their meanings, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    
    
    \item[-] \textbf{Artificial Intelligence (AI) Model}: A program that analyzes datasets to identify patterns and make predictions. Used extensively in medical image analysis for automating diagnostics. 
    
    \item[-] \textbf{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}: A deep learning algorithm that processes images by assigning weights and biases, allowing it to identify patterns and features in medical images such as chest X-rays.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{Detection Transformer (DETR)}: A transformer-based neural network model for object detection. It uses an encoder-decoder transformer architecture to directly predict bounding boxes and class labels from an image, simplifying the detection process.

    \item[-] \textbf{React}: A web front-end framework, written in Javascript.
    \item[-] \textbf{Flask}: An HTTP-based server framework, written in Python.
    \item[-] \textbf{Finite State Machine (FSM)}: A computation model that simulates sequential logic using state transitions, applied in processes like user authentication and backend workflows.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)}: A graph that shows the performance of a classification model by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold levels.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{Service-Level Agreement (SLA)}: Defines the guaranteed uptime of the system, such as ensuring the availability of the AI service for 99.99\% of operational hours.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)}: Software classified as a medical device under regulatory frameworks, such as those defined by the Food and Drugs Act.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{TorchXRAYVision}: An open-source library for classifying diseases based on chest X-ray images, offering pre-trained models to accelerate the development process.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{X-ray}: A form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation used in medical imaging to produce images of the inside of the body, enabling the diagnosis of conditions through radiographic film or digital detectors.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{MIT License}: An open-source software license that allows for the free use, modification, and distribution of software.
    
    \item[-] \textbf{Training Data}: Refers to the dataset of labeled chest X-ray images used to train the AI model. In this project, the dataset size is approximately 471.12 GB.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
