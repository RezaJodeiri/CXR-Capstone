\section{Changes Due to Testing}

To run automated tests within a developer’s local environment, a developer can execute a command to build the project. This process ensures that all dependencies are correctly set up and runs the automated tests for both Python and React.js.\\\\
If a developer wants to run only the tests, they can navigate to the appropriate directory where the tests are located and execute the relevant test command. For Python, this typically involves running pytest or Flake8, while for React.js, Jest is used.\\\\
We have tests that are executed using AWS services, with results and logs stored in Amazon S3 for easy access and review. This setup ensures that test results are centralized and accessible across for the team. The automation helps maintain code quality, catch errors early, and streamline the deployment process.\\
From the repository’s perspective, tests are executed using Github CI/CD to maintain code quality and stability. Both linting and compilation are performed using the same commands that a developer would execute in their local environment. Specifically, we use Flake8 for Python linting and Jest for testing React.js components.\\\\
These tests are triggered when a new pull request is made to the main branch. If any test fails, merging is blocked until the issues are resolved. This ensures that only verified, high-quality code is integrated. Additionally, a compiler workflow runs after merging into the main branch to detect any errors or unintended changes in code behavior.\\\\
If any test or workflow fails, the detailed logs provide valuable insights into the reason for failure. This allows developers to quickly diagnose and address issues, preventing regressions and ensuring a smooth development process. By enforcing these automated checks, we maintain code consistency, reduce bugs, and improve overall project reliability.\\\\

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
