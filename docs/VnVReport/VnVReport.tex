xray                    & This project only contains backend structure for the AI model, which uses a smaller dataset compared to other projects and uses the resnet-50 network for disease classification. & \url{https://github.com/LalehSeyyed/CheXclusion}            & \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00827v2}                        \\ \hline
ChestLenseAI            & This project uses a minimal Frontend and applies the DenseNet-121 pre-trained model to detect diseases in chest X-ray images.  & \url{https://github.com/LaurentVeyssier/Chest-X-Ray-Medical-Diagnosis-with-Deep-Learning/tree/main}  & \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05225}                          \\ \hline
CheXRelFormer           & This project is purely focused on the backend ViT model, it does not use a pre-trained network for disease progress between two x-ray images. It is a very advanced (PhD) project which is developed with no prior related research.  & N/A                                                      & N/A                                                          \\ \hline

graduate attribute of Reflection.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
