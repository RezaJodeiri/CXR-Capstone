\section{Introduction}

Following the principles outlined by \citet{leveson_engineering_2011}, a hazard in our AI-based chest X-ray analysis system is any condition or event that could negatively affect the system's operation, integrity, or safety. This includes software bugs, hardware failures, user mistakes, or external disruptions. A hazard becomes significant when it might interfere with the system's ability to provide accurate diagnostic support, protect patient confidentiality, or operate reliably in clinical settings.
\newline
This document presents a detailed hazard analysis of our AI-powered chest X-ray analysis application. Throughout this document, we identify potential hazards and suggest ways to eliminate or reduce them. By examining different types of hazards, assessing how likely they are to happen and how severe they might be, and proposing actions to address them, we aim to improve the safety and security requirements for our project.

\section{Scope and Purpose}

The purpose of this hazard analysis is to identify potential hazards in our AI-based chest X-ray analysis system and to propose ways to mitigate them. We focus on specific system components and boundaries to enhance the safety and reliability of the system. While we recognize that certain external factors, like differences in input image quality or user environments, are beyond our control, our system is designed to handle standard digital chest X-ray images provided by qualified healthcare professionals.
\newline
We assume that all system functions—especially those related to image processing, AI analysis, and reporting results—are working as intended. With this in mind, we concentrate on strengthening key components, such as the user interface, backend servers, machine learning models, and data storage systems, to prevent potential failures. Our goal is to ensure that the system provides an accurate, secure, and reliable experience that supports healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing chest diseases.

\section{System Boundaries}

\subsection{System Components}

The system consists of the following main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] User Interface (Web Application)
    \item[-] Backend Servers and APIs
    \item[-] Machine Learning Model and Inference Engine
    \item[-] Data Storage and Management Systems
    \item[-] Security and Authentication Modules
\end{itemize}
These components are essential to our system's functionality. They handle user interactions, data processing, AI-based analysis, and secure data management.

\subsection{Environment Components}

The system interacts with the following external components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] External Medical Imaging Systems (e.g., Picture Archiving and Communication Systems)
    \item[-] Standard Digital Chest X-ray Images
    \item[-] Network Infrastructure (Internet Connectivity)
\end{itemize}
These environment components influence how our system operates. While they are outside our system, they play a critical role in ensuring a smooth and effective user experience in clinical settings.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

To keep the hazard assessment focused and effective, we make the following critical assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {We expect users to upload only legitimate and appropriate medical images. However, we recognize that irrelevant or corrupted data may sometimes be uploaded, and measures should be in place to detect and handle such inputs.}

    \item {We assume that users are qualified healthcare professionals with the necessary training to interpret the system's outputs correctly. The system is primarily intended for professional use in clinical settings.}
    \item {Our system is designed to handle unintentional user errors and common misuse scenarios, but it may not be fully protected against deliberate malicious activities aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities or deceiving the AI algorithms.}
    \item {Our hazard analysis for external environment components, like network infrastructure and third-party systems, considers typical use cases and does not cover extreme conditions outside the intended operation of the system.}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}
The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was selected as the hazard analysis tool to help identify, assess, and propose solutions to the risks and hazards associated with our AI-based chest X-ray analysis system.

\subsection{Hazards Out of Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Failures related to external AI libraries (e.g., TorchXRayVision)
    \item[-] Issues due to external data sources (e.g., incorrect image formats or corrupted data files)
    \item[-] Failures of the external hardware used by healthcare professionals
\end{itemize}
Our project is not responsible for the hazards listed above, as they are controlled by third-party systems or external users. While we will take steps to minimize the impact of these hazards, complete mitigation cannot be guaranteed.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
\end{enumerate}
