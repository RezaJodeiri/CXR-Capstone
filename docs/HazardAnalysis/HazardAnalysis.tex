\section{Introduction}

Following the principles outlined by \cite{leveson2011}, a hazard in our AI-based chest X-ray analysis system is any condition or event that could negatively affect the system's operation, integrity, or safety. This includes software bugs, hardware failures, user mistakes, or external disruptions. A hazard becomes significant when it might interfere with the system's ability to provide accurate diagnostic support, protect patient confidentiality, or operate reliably in clinical settings.
\newline
This document presents a detailed hazard analysis of our AI-powered chest X-ray analysis application. Throughout this document, we identify potential hazards and suggest ways to eliminate or reduce them. By examining different types of hazards, assessing how likely they are to happen and how severe they might be, and proposing actions to address them, we aim to improve the safety and security requirements for our project.

\section{Scope and Purpose}

The purpose of this analysis is to identify potential hazards in our AI-based chest X-ray analysis system and to propose ways to mitigate them. We focus on specific system components and boundaries to enhance the safety and reliability of the system. While we recognize that certain external factors, like differences in input image quality or user environments, are beyond our control, our system is designed to handle standard digital chest X-ray images provided by qualified healthcare professionals.
\newline
We assume that all system functions—especially those related to image processing, AI analysis, and reporting results—are working as intended. With this in mind, we concentrate on strengthening key components, such as the user interface, backend servers, machine learning models, and data storage systems, to prevent potential failures. Our goal is to ensure that the system provides an accurate, secure, and reliable experience that supports healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing chest diseases.

\section{System Boundaries}

\subsection{System Components}

The system consists of the following main components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] User Interface (Web Application)
    \item[-] Backend Servers and APIs
    \item[-] Machine Learning Model and Inference Engine
    \item[-] Data Storage and Management Systems
    \item[-] Security and Authentication Modules
\end{itemize}
These components are essential to our system's functionality. They handle user interactions, data processing, AI-based analysis, and secure data management.

\subsection{Environment Components}

The system interacts with the following external components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] External Medical Imaging Systems (e.g., Picture Archiving and Communication Systems)
    \item[-] Standard Digital Chest X-ray Images
    \item[-] Network Infrastructure (Internet Connectivity)
\end{itemize}
These environment components influence how our system operates. While they are outside our system, they play a critical role in ensuring a smooth and effective user experience in clinical settings.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

To keep the hazard assessment focused and effective, we make the following critical assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {We expect users to upload only legitimate and appropriate medical images. However, we recognize that irrelevant or corrupted data may sometimes be uploaded, and measures should be in place to detect and handle such inputs.}

    \item {We assume that users are qualified healthcare professionals with the necessary training to interpret the system's outputs correctly. The system is primarily intended for professional use in clinical settings.}
    \item {Our system is designed to handle unintentional user errors and common misuse scenarios, but it may not be fully protected against deliberate malicious activities aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities or deceiving the AI algorithms.}
    \item {Our hazard analysis for external environment components, like network infrastructure and third-party systems, considers typical use cases and does not cover extreme conditions outside the intended operation of the system.}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}
The Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) was selected as the hazard analysis tool to help identify, assess, and propose solutions to the risks and hazards associated with our AI-based chest X-ray analysis system.

\subsection{Hazards Out of Scope}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Failures related to external AI libraries (e.g., TorchXRayVision)
    \item[-] Issues due to external data sources (e.g., incorrect image formats or corrupted data files)
    \item[-] Failures of the external hardware used by healthcare professionals
\end{itemize}
Our project is not responsible for the hazards listed above, as they are controlled by third-party systems or external users. While we will take steps to minimize the impact of these hazards, complete mitigation cannot be guaranteed.

\section{Roadmap}

In the hazard analysis and FMEA documentation for our chest X-ray diagnostic system, we have identified and prioritized a comprehensive set of safety and security requirements to mitigate potential hazards. These requirements aim to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the system, while addressing essential privacy, safety, and usability concerns in a clinical environment.

\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent Requirements focusing on fundamental safety and security priorities, such as ensuring the correctness of AI-generated diagnoses, preserving user privacy, and minimizing patient risk, are given the highest priority. These include \hyperlink{SR1}{SR1}, \hyperlink{SR2}{SR2}, \hyperlink{SR5}{SR5}, \hyperlink{HS1}{HS1}, \hyperlink{HS2}{HS2}, and \hyperlink{HS5}{HS5}. Implementing these will ensure that the core functionalities, such as diagnosis review by medical professionals and anonymization of sensitive data, are in place by the end of the capstone project to reduce the likelihood of critical errors and privacy breaches.

\noindent High-priority requirements focused on operational continuity, such as system availability during peak loads, responsive user interfaces, and the management of backend downtime, will also be addressed within the project timeline. These include \hyperlink{HS3}{HS3}, \hyperlink{SR6}{SR6}, \hyperlink{SR4}{SR4}, and \hyperlink{HS6}{HS6}, which are essential for sustaining a seamless clinical workflow and ensuring minimal disruptions during diagnosis.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent Some requirements aimed at further enhancing the system’s long-term usability and performance will be postponed for future implementation. These include advanced quality monitoring of uploaded images (\hyperlink{SR2}{SR2}), integration of patient feedback mechanisms (\hyperlink{HS4}{HS4}), and additional fatigue management improvements for clinicians (\hyperlink{HS3}{HS3}). While these features are beneficial for improving efficiency and user satisfaction, they are considered medium priority and will be explored after the initial system is operational.
\vspace{0.2cm}

\noindent Given the scope and time constraints of the capstone project, the roadmap prioritizes essential safety, security, and operational requirements to be implemented during the course. The remaining non-critical requirements will be reserved for future iterations. This roadmap will ensure that our chest X-ray diagnostic system evolves towards meeting high standards of safety, usability, and compliance, aligning with clinical needs and regulatory requirements.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}


\begin{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{What went well while writing this deliverable?}

    Writing this hazard analysis allowed us to think more critically and in specific layers about our AI-based chest X-ray analysis system. By breaking down the project into major components like the user interface, backend servers, machine learning models, and data storage, we were able to systematically identify and analyze potential hazards associated with each part. This detailed examination enabled us to anticipate risks ahead of the implementation phase and develop effective mitigation strategies. The process not only deepened our understanding of the system's nuances but also ensured that we considered a wide range of failure modes and their effects through a comprehensive FMEA analysis. Additionally, aligning our safety and security requirements with industry standards and regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR helped strengthen the overall quality and compliance of the deliverable.
    \item \textbf{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?}

    One of the main challenges was ensuring that we captured all relevant hazards, especially those that are not immediately obvious, such as ethical biases in AI models or regulatory compliance issues. Initially, our focus was mostly on technical failures and user interface problems. To overcome this, we broadened our perspective by consulting additional resources and engaging with our supervisor Dr. Mehdi Mordadi who is an experts in the field of medical imaging. This helped us identify and incorporate hazards related to data privacy, AI bias, and user training into our analysis. Another pain point was managing the complexity of interrelated system components. We resolved this by clearly defining system boundaries and assumptions, which streamlined our analysis process.
    \item \textbf{Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this
    deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For
    the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how
    did they come about?}

    Before this deliverable, we had already considered risks such as incorrect AI diagnoses due to model inaccuracies (\hyperlink{H4-1}{H4-1}), data loss or corruption (\hyperlink{H6-1}{H6-1}), and security breaches leading to unauthorized access of patient data (\hyperlink{H7-1}{H7-1}). These risks were apparent due to the critical nature of healthcare data and diagnostics.

    While conducting the hazard analysis, we identified additional risks, including:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] AI model failing to improve over time (\hyperlink{H4-2}{H4-2}): We identified that without continuous learning and updates, the AI model might become outdated, especially as new medical findings are discovered.
        \item[-]Failure to handle poor-quality images (\hyperlink{H1-2}{H1-2}): We realized that image quality significantly impacts AI analysis accuracy. This hazard emerged when examining the image input component and considering real-world scenarios where image quality might vary.
        \item[-]User interface challenges leading to misinterpretation of results (\hyperlink{H2-2}{H2-2}): During the FMEA, we recognized that even if the AI model is accurate, a confusing UI could mislead users, causing misdiagnosis.
    \end{itemize}

    These hazards came to light as we methodically assessed each component's failure modes and their potential effects, encouraging us to think beyond initial assumptions.
    \item \textbf{Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any
    appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in
    software products. Why are they important to consider?
    software products. Why are they important to consider?}
    Neuralanalyzer is a complex system with many components. However our team has considered the following two as ones of the \textbf{highest risks}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Unreliable prediction models lead to misdiagnoses}: This risk was identified as the highest risk since the product primary selling point is the accuracy of the AI models. There are many reasons for this risk to occur:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] \textbf{Model's ability to recognize chest-embedded medical device}: Devices such as chest tubes, pacemakers, or defibrillators can be misinterpreted as medical conditions by the model.
            \item[-] \textbf{Biased training data}: When the chest X-Ray data is only from a specific demographic, scanning machine, or hospital, the model will tend to over-fit to that specific data bias. This will lead to unreliable results on other demographics, machines, or hospitals.
            \item[-] \textbf{Insufficient training data}: When the model is trained on a small dataset, it will not be able to generalize well on new data, leading to unreliable results.
            \item[-] \textbf{Developer's operation errors}: When developers make mistakes with the model's architecture, training, or deployment, it will affect the downtime of the AI service.
        \end{itemize}
        Given the severity of this risk, our team has came up with a strategy to minimize this risk on production:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] \textbf{Gather big and diverse Chest X-ray images}, from multiple sources: Under the supervision of Dr. Mehdi, we will be training our model with \href{https://physionet.org/content/chest-imagenome/1.0.0/}{Imagenome} and \href{https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/}{ChexPert} datasets, which are well-known and massive datasets.
            \item[-] \textbf{Transfer Learning and tuning pre-trained models}: As mentioned within SRS, we will utilize the TorchXrayVision model as our back-up mechanism. Since this model is pre-trained on ChexPert, our team will be performing additional training with Imagenome on top of TorchXrayVision.
            \item[-] \textbf{Automate Developers workflow with CI/CD and automation scripts}: Developers operation such as data handling, version control, model deployment and model re-training should be automated to reduce human errors.
        \end{itemize}
        
        
        \item \textbf{System's SLA is not met due to unexpected downtime}: Hospitals when using Neuralanalyzer system will under the assumption that our system will be up, as agreed in the SLA, to serve patients diagnosis. However, there are multiple reasons for the system to go down unexpectedly:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] \textbf{Unreliable CI/CD pipeline}: When the CI/CD pipeline is not developed and tested thoroughly, buggy code can be deployed to production, leading to unexpected crashes and downtime.
            \item[-] \textbf{Unmonitored logs and resources}: Some operational issues might run through CI/CD undetected until very later on, such as spikes in traffic, high CPU usage, or memory leaks. These issues will lead to performance degradation and eventually system crashes.
            \item[-] \textbf{Deployment of major versions}: Minor versions changes are not considered as risky as major versions changes. Major versions changes usually introduce breaking changes that will affect production reliability if not tested properly. When major versions are introduce, the team must ensure egregious testing and provides backwards-compatibility analysis.
        \end{itemize}
        The risk of unexpected downtime can be handled in many ways, with many tools available on the markets, such as AWS CloudWatch, Datadog, PagerDuty, etc. In the context of Neuralanalyzer's Capstone implementation, we will negate downtime via the following methods:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item[-] \textbf{Implementing log monitoring}: automatically notify developers when a certain level of errors had occurred via email/SMS. Developers will then come online to fix the problem.
            \item[-] \textbf{Implementing a manual rollback mechanism}: When a bug takes too long to trace and debug, developers should be able to rollback their changes to the previous stable working state.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
