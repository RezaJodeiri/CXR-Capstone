\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approachh to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

% \subsection{Overview}
% This Module Guide Document serves as a design blueprint for CXR - a web-based chest X-ray analysis application developed to support healthcare professionals in diagnosing and monitoring respiratory and cardiac conditions. It provides a modular overview of the project, enabling the development team to build a platform that prioritizes accurate diagnostics, efficient performance, and seamless integration into existing medical workflows.

% \subsection{Purpose}
% The aim of this Module Guide Document is to detail the architecture of modules, based on selected design principles and patterns, to clarify the project’s functionalities and the specific roles of each module.

% \subsection{Design Principles}
% The Module Guide will emphasize modularity, scalability, and separation of concerns for efficient, maintainable design. It promotes reusability, interoperability, and security while ensuring simplicity, robustness, and testability. Consistent standards and traceability will streamline development and maintenance.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are adjustments expected during the project lifecycle and are designed to minimize the impact on the overall system. These changes are encapsulated within specific modules to ensure that the modifications affect only the corresponding module. This strategy is referred to as "design for change."

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific hardware configurations on which the AI model runs may evolve as technology advances, including GPU updates for faster computations or better memory handling.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format or structure of input chest X-rays might vary, such as accommodating different resolutions or adding metadata for enhanced analysis.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acCompliance}:] Changes in healthcare regulations could require modifications to the model’s outputs or data handling to ensure compliance with privacy and security standards.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDisease}:] Expanding or refining the list of detectable diseases as new medical research or datasets become available.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUI}:] Adjustments to the front-end interface to make it more user-friendly for medical professionals, incorporating feedback from usability studies.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acErrorHandling}:] Introducing or refining mechanisms to manage edge cases, such as incomplete or corrupted input data.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acPreprocessing}:] Enhancements to image preprocessing, such as noise reduction, normalization, or resizing techniques, to improve the quality of input data.

\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

Unlikely changes are those that are not expected to occur during the project lifecycle. These changes typically involve fundamental shifts in the system's scope, technology, or purpose and would require significant effort to implement.


\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucFrameworkMigration}:] Switching from PyTorch to an entirely different deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or JAX, is unlikely due to the associated complexity and cost.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucPurpose}:] A change in the primary use case, such as shifting from diagnostic support to research-oriented predictions, is considered unlikely.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucObjective}:] Shifting the AI model's purpose from disease prediction to a completely different application, such as general image classification.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucNonAI}:] Eliminating the AI model and replacing it with traditional statistical methods or rule-based systems.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucScopeExpansion}:] Expanding the system to predict non-chest-related diseases or conditions beyond its initial design focus or the project's current scope.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct implementation of B. Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between the modules.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.1\textwidth]{../../assets/ContextDesignFlow.png}
\caption{Use Hierarchy Diagram showing module interactions}
\label{FigUH}
\end{figure}

\noindent The architecture follows a hybrid design pattern combining Model-View-Controller (MVC) for the machine learning components and client-server architecture for the view modules. The machine learning modules are structured with clear separation between the model logic, view presentation, and control flow. The view modules interact with patient data through requests to the web server module, which in turn communicates with the data persistence module. For simplicity, the diagram omits the request arrows between views and the web server module, as well as between modules and the data persistence layer. This modular design enables independent testing and development of components while maintaining clear interfaces between layers.

\item Receive disease predictions and progression analysis
\item Generate and edit a final report (with prescriptions/notes), automatically linked in the patient’s record
\item See basic metrics (ROC/AUC) for the ML model’s performance
\item Use a partially tested, but stable, CI/CD pipeline that automates builds/deployments
\end{itemize}

\noindent Additional refinement or advanced features can be scheduled for post-Rev-0 milestones if time permits.
