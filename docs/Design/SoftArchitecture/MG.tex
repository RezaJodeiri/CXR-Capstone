\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approachh to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are adjustments expected during the project lifecycle and are designed to minimize the impact on the overall system. These changes are encapsulated within specific modules to ensure that the modifications affect only the corresponding module. This strategy is referred to as "design for change."

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acHardware}:] The specific hardware configurations on which the AI model runs may evolve as technology advances, including GPU updates for faster computations or better memory handling.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInput}:] The format or structure of input chest X-rays might vary, such as accommodating different resolutions or adding metadata for enhanced analysis.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acCompliance}:] Changes in healthcare regulations could require modifications to the model’s outputs or data handling to ensure compliance with privacy and security standards.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acDisease}:] Refining the list of detectable diseases as new medical research or datasets become available.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acUI}:] Adjustments to the front-end interface to make it more user-friendly for medical professionals, incorporating feedback from usability studies.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acErrorHandling}:] Introducing or refining mechanisms to manage edge cases, such as incomplete or corrupted input data.

\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acPreprocessing}:] Enhancements to image preprocessing, such as noise reduction, normalization, or resizing techniques, to improve the quality of input data.

\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

Unlikely changes are those that are not expected to occur during the project lifecycle. These changes typically involve fundamental shifts in the system's scope, technology, or purpose and would require significant effort to implement.


\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucFrameworkMigration}:] Switching from PyTorch to an entirely different deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or JAX, is unlikely due to the associated complexity and cost.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucPurpose}:] A change in the primary use case, such as shifting from diagnostic support to research-oriented predictions, is considered unlikely.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucObjective}:] Shifting the AI model's purpose from disease prediction to a completely different application, such as general image classification.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucNonAI}:] Eliminating the AI model and replacing it with traditional statistical methods or rule-based systems.

\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucScopeExpansion}:] Expanding the system to predict non-chest-related diseases or conditions beyond its initial design focus or the project's current scope.
\end{description}

in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.
\newline
Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}
In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels. For viewing the image with better clarity please cleas

\subsection{Architecture Summary}
\noindent This system is organized into three main layers---a User Interface layer, an Application/Domain layer, and a Data Persistence layer---each with clear responsibilities and well-defined interfaces:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Interface Layer} \\
    This layer provides all patient-facing and clinician-facing views. For example, the Patient List View, Patient Overview View, Medical Record List View, Disease Progression View, and X-Ray Report View each issue function calls (e.g., ``Get Patient Information,'' ``Get Records for Patient,'' etc.) to request data and operations.These views communicate with the Web Application Server in the Application/Domain layer.

    \item \textbf{Application/Domain Layer} \\
    At this layer, the Web Application Server routes requests to the HTTP Server, which in turn orchestrates calls to the core modules:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[-] \textbf{User Authentication Module} -- Manages user login, sign-up, edit, and authentication.
        \item[-] \textbf{Disease Progression Module} -- Retrieves and processes progression data, possibly delegating to the external Disease Progression Server via HTTP.
        \item[-] \textbf{Disease Prediction Module} -- Handles machine-learning predictions for patient records, again leveraging an external Disease Prediction Server.
        \item[-] \textbf{Medical Record Management Module} -- Allows creating, reading, editing, and deleting patient records and prescriptions.
    \end{itemize}
    These modules may also request X-ray images from the Data Persistence layer or send them to the Disease Progression / Prediction servers for further analysis.

    \item \textbf{Data Persistence Layer} \\
    The Data Persistence Module handles storage and retrieval of patient information, records, and X-ray images. All modules in the Application/Domain layer can communicate with this layer to read or persist data as needed.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent By separating concerns into these three layers, the architecture remains modular, enabling independent development, testing, and maintenance of each layer while also decoupling the disease prediction and progression machine learning models.

\section{User Interfaces}
The user interface design consists of several key pages that have been prototyped in Figma:

\begin{itemize}
\item A login page for secure user authentication
\item A dashboard showing critical patient statistics and recent X-rays
\item A patient records page displaying medical history and X-ray images
\item A detailed X-ray analysis page with disease detection results
\item A report generation page for doctors to document findings and prescriptions
\item A disease progression tracking interface to monitor changes over time
\end{itemize}

The complete interactive mockups can be viewed at \href{https://www.figma.com/design/HAjX8dhwPjPSzX2Wz06YQ2/Capstone-App?node-id=134-122&t=8ET1qlba7wlarEvq-0}{our Figma design}.
