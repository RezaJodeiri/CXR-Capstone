\section{Introduction}

Chest X-rays are one of the most common diagnostic imaging techniques used in clinical practice for evaluating respiratory and cardiac conditions. However, the interpretation of chest X-ray images can be complex and time-consuming that requires high-level expertise and experience. Misinterpretations can lead to wrong diagnoses and inappropriate treatment plans, increasing the healthcare costs.\\

As healthcare professionals are facing challenges in accurately and efficiently diagnosing abnormalities from chest X-ray images, there is a urgent need for a reliable, efficient and user-friendly AI/ML tool that helps them with interpreting chest X-ray images.\\

In this section, the document will go through the purpose of this SRS document, scope of requirements, characteristics of intended readers and organization of this SRS.\\



\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The purpose of this SRS document is to provide a foundation that guides the design, development and implementation of the software. The primary purposes of the SRS document includes providing a shared understanding of the software requirements between stakeholders and developers. It defines the scope of the software project and details the what functionalities will be included and what will not be included. It serves as a comprehensive guide for developers and outlines the system constraints, properties of a correct solution, functional and non-functional requirements. It also states the potential changes to the software project, and provides a structured approach to manage changes in the software project.\\

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope of this project is to take in a chest X-ray image and output if any diseases / abnormalities are detected. In the training process, labels need to include both disease categories and areas of abnormality. The datasets also should represent diverse patient demographics (age, gender etc) and include different scenarios including rare diseases. Input X-rays also should be of high resolution and captured with standard machines. The project is not designed for reading all types of medical imaging and is only specialized for chest X-rays. The project is not meant to fully automate X-ray reading but only to assist with specific tasks like identifying diseases / abnormalities and supporting decision-making. Certain rare / high complex diseases may fall outside the system's training data which lead to limitations in detection. The system does not account for patient history, or other test results that are crucial for diagnosis. The system cannot determine what cause the diseases / abnormalities or predict long-term outcomes. \\

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

The reader of this SRS document should possess undergraduate level of software development skill as it specifies the system constraints, functional and non-functional requirements. Reader should understand the theories of software development as this SRS contains sections about theoretical models and instance models. Readers should also have some basic experience with project management to understand the development plan and the traceability matrix. Ideally, user should have some fundamental understanding of Artificial Intelligence but this is not a required characteristic as the SRS focuses more on the requirements instead of the technical side. To understand input data types and other constraints on data, reader should have at least 1 year programming experiences.\\

\subsection{Stakeholders}
1. Healthcare Providers: they are the primary uses of the AI system, as the software will help them in interpreting chest X-rays more efficiently by detecting abnormalities and analyzing potential diseases. The use of this software as part of the diagnostic process will help improve efficiency and accuracy.
\\
\\
2. Patients: they benefit from faster, more accurate diagnoses with a improved healthcare accessibility. They also can get early detection of life-threatening diseases.\\
\\
3. Hospitals and Clinics: Hospitals and clinics can integrate the software into their hospital systems, which can help them to improve efficiency, reduce diagnostic errors, manage costs.\\
\\
4. Technical Support team: they are responsible for ensuring seamless connectivity with existing systems, maintaining workflow, and ensuring data security and privacy. \\

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints. \\

\subsection{System Context}

The below system context diagram shows that the system will take in an input (chest X-ray image) from the user after they login. The user upload the chest X-ray image to the system and then system will annotate and provide the interpretation of the X-ray image back to the user.



\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Need to ensure that the chest X-ray image is of high resolution. }
\item {Need to ensure that the chest X-ray image is a chest X-ray image, not other types of medical images.}
\item {Need to ensure that the chest X-ray image taken by standard machines. Images with poor lighting, noises or does not follow standard protocols will not be accepted. }
\end{itemize}
\item Program Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Detect abnormalities / diseases in the chest X-ray images.}
\item {Classify abnormalities / diseases into specific categories.}
\item {Quantify size / degree / volume of abnormalities.}
\item {Produce report with possiblee diagnosis and the above information.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The software is typically used in medical and clinical contexts to support healthcare professionals and physicians to speed up X-ray readings and improve accuracy in diagnosis. It is a safety critical application as failure could lead to delay in treatment, misdiagnosis and potentially severe outcomes for the patient.


\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The user of this software application will primarily be patients and physicians. The end user should be able to read / understand middle school level English. The end user should also have a basic understanding of chest-related diseases, advanced knowledge is preferred but not required. Users can consult professionals if they have trouble interpreting the result. The user should also know to to upload X-ray images via web app from local machine and have basic knowledge of how to use computer / laptop. \\

\subsection{System Constraints}

1. Computational resources: Limited processing power and memory might affect the speed and efficiency of the AI algorithms.\\
\\
2. Data quality: Biased or blurry data can lead to inaccurate results.\\
\\
3. Compatibility: The software will only be supported on Windows 10 or higher and macOS 12 or higher. \\
\\
4. Ethical considerations: If the training data lacks diversity, the AI may perform poorly for certain populations. \\
\\
5. Regulatory constraints: Delays in obtaining necessary approvals can hinder deployment and development stages.\\

\section{Specific System Description}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description}
Disease prediction via medical imaging continues to be one of the most important aspect of health-care. However, the health-care industry is still slowly catching up with current technology, making disease prediction and prevention processes labour-intensive and inefficient. With a prolong history in operation, countless images has been captured from CT Scanners and X-Ray machines, for medical and health-care research, but yet to be applied in hospital settings between physicians and patients.

Our team, Neuralanalyzer, saw an opportunity to transform traditional health-care processes, by applying Machine Learning, and modern software engineering techniques; aiming to provide an optimized, unified, and HIPAA-compliant platform to predict diseases from chest X-Ray scans.

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\noindent Given the inputs and the constraints of the system, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_prediction_accuracy}:] \textbf{High Prediction Accuracy: }Machine Learning Model used by Neuralanalyzer must have a high prediction accuracy for Chest X-Ray images. We are aiming for a minimum of 75\% accuracy.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_ease_of_ML_intro}:] \textbf{Simple to introduce more ML models: }New classifier models must be simple and intuitive to be integrated with the system, with short time-to-market. This goal will require a containerized ML-plugin code template (in Python) and guidelines documentations for new models to follow.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_fault-tolerance}:] \textbf{High Fault-Tolerance: }Neuralanalyzer's system (front-end, back-end, ML-plugins) must handle run-time errors as clever as possible, to prevents run-time crashes, and unwanted downtime. Comprehensive unit and integration testings must be present, to reduce errors and bugs within the system.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_good_UI}:] \textbf{Intuitive UI/UX: }Neuralanalyzer's front-end must be user-friendly and straight-forward to be used. Front-end's core features such as login, account registration, and image-prediction should require as few clicks as possible.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_dev_work_automation}:] \textbf{High automation of Dev-workflow: }Repetitive, and crucial development workflows must be implemented within Github Actions. Example including: Unit \& Integration Testing, Linting Check, Docker Image build, Deployment on AWS.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_avaialblity}:] \textbf{High Availability: }Neuralanalyzer application must be highly available, with very minimal downtime. Our team aiming to have our targeted SLA as 99\%.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_data_security}:] \textbf{Secure Data Transfer \& Hosting: }Image-related operations, such as storing, transferring via front-end, ML-training must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted. This requires an introduction of a authentication service, which our team will be using AWS Cognito.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}
\subsubsection{Architectural Decisions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A. Splitting up the AI-Models from the core Neuralanalyzer back-end service.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Allowing separate development and deployment of AI-Models, and other application logic (authentication, databases, etc.)
            \item Enabling the ability to connect multiple models, via plugins, onto the system, providing Neuralanalyzer with more flexibility.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Drawbacks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Increase complexity in managing source code, and at run-time. For example: runtime security, availability, service discovery, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
\item B. Training Neuralanalyzer ML Model on CAS Department's servers.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Massively speeds up research and development since department's servers are already set-up with student's MacID.
            \item Reducing cost for AI-Model training.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Drawbacks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This separate training process makes this particular development workflow hard and time-consuming to automate.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
\item C. Including TorchXRayVision as a back-up model.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ability to quickly create a working and stable MVP, which contains the front-end, back-end, and the ML model.
            \item Ability to apply transfer-learning on to this model to fine-tune its accuracy.
            \item Ability to change the source code of this model to fit's our team's need.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Drawbacks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Un-ability to re-train the model.
            \item Out-of-the-box model has low accuraccy score.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}
\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] Machine Learning Models Performance will be tracked via a standardized method, and this method will be publicly published after being developed. Reason being the accuracy of the ML model is vital for the end-user (physicians, patients), therefore this validation method needs transparency to the stakeholders, and users.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] All health-related data that are not publicly available, needs to be handled in a HIPPA-compliance manner. Reason being private PHI are sensitive are are protected under this act.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] McMaster Department's servers will be available for our group members to perform model training and development. Under another assumption that our group members, as users of department resources must follows department's guidelines.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints} 
From the system perspective, the input data can be any image, of any size, in any format. Our system will only output the correct label for images of chest x-ray scan. Example below.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{chest-x-ray.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Properties of a Correct Solution} \label{sec_CorrectSolution}
In the context of our machine learning model, the absolute correct solution can not be calculated at run-time. However, A solution is considered good enough when during in the training and validation process,  the error rate of the system has been reduced to an agreeable number.

\section{Required Behaviour Overview}
Neuralanalyzer's system is composed of 3 main sub-systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Neuralanalyzer Front-end}: Responsible for handling user's interaction via a web-based UI. The front-end will be responsible for core functionalities such as login, account registration, image uploading.
    \item \textbf{Neuralanalyzer Back-end}: Responsible for handling front-end calls, authentication logic, and ML-plugins interactions. The back-end will follow a stateless design pattern, optimized for horizontal scalling.
    \item \textbf{Neuralanalyzer ML Plugins}: Responsible for taking in images, and returns a prediction vector with high accuracy and high-throughput. The ML-plugins will also follow a stateless design pattern, optimized for horizontal scalling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Formal Mathematical Specification}

\subsubsection{Formal Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let \( X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \) be the set of chest X-ray images, where \( x_i \) represents each individual image.
  \item Let \( Y = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\} \) be the set of labels, where \( y_i \in \{0, 1\} \). Here, \( y_i = 1 \) indicates the presence of a disease, and \( y_i = 0 \) indicates its absence.
  \item Let \( M \) be the machine learning model used for disease detection.
  \item Let \( \theta \) represent the parameters of model \( M \), which are learned during training.
  \item Let \( P(x_i) \) represent the probability that an image \( x_i \) is classified as containing a disease by the model \( M \).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Formal Expressions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Training the Model:}
    \begin{align*}
      \theta^* &= \text{arg min}_\theta \sum_{i=1}^n (M(x_i; \theta) - y_i)^2 \\
      &\text{where } M(x_i; \theta) \text{ is the predicted value for } x_i.
    \end{align*}
    The model parameters \( \theta \) are adjusted during training to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual labels.

  \item \textbf{Prediction:}
    \begin{align*}
      \hat{y}_i &= \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } P(x_i) \geq 0.5 \\
        0 & \text{if } P(x_i) < 0.5
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    The model predicts \( \hat{y}_i = 1 \) (disease present) if the probability \( P(x_i) \) is greater than or equal to 0.5, and \( \hat{y}_i = 0 \) (disease absent) otherwise.

  \item \textbf{Evaluation:}
    \begin{align*}
      \text{Accuracy} &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i = y_i)}{n} \\
      &\text{where } \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i = y_i) \text{ equals 1 if the prediction is correct, otherwise 0.}
    \end{align*}
    Accuracy measures the proportion of images for which the model's predictions match the actual labels.

  \item \textbf{Loss Function:}
    \begin{align*}
      L(\theta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n (M(x_i; \theta) - y_i)^2
    \end{align*}
    The loss function measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual labels. The model aims to minimize this function during training.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Model Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The model \( M \) should achieve an accuracy of at least 85\% on the validation dataset.
  \item Each input image \( x_i \) should be preprocessed to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) to ensure compatibility with the model.
  \item The probability threshold for classification is set at 0.5, but it can be adjusted based on the desired sensitivity of the model.
\end{itemize}

\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Uptime:} 99.99\% – Ensures near-continuous availability of the AI system, minimizing downtime for uninterrupted analysis and diagnostics.
    \item \textbf{Training Photos:} 471.12 GB (zipped) – A substantial dataset of chest X-rays used to train the AI model, contributing to its robustness and accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Accuracy Rate:} 90\% – The model achieves a high accuracy rate in classifying and diagnosing chest X-rays, balancing precision with speed for practical clinical use.
    \item \textbf{Response Time:} Less than 1 second per image – The system is optimized to provide immediate feedback on X-ray results, significantly reducing wait times.
\end{itemize}

\section{Impact Analysis}
This project is primarily designed for rapid recognition of chest X-rays in the field of thoracic medicine through artificial intelligence. Its main significance lies in the ability to quickly display preliminary diagnostic results, thereby improving recognition efficiency and reducing patient wait times. Additionally, the system can be used for big data classification, gradually improving the accuracy of analyses, reducing misdiagnoses, and easing the workload of doctors. If this project can be deployed on a large scale, it will enhance productivity in the medical field, lower healthcare costs, and speed up medical services. Moreover, by utilizing cloud technology, it can help people living in remote areas to obtain basic assessments from X-rays without needing a doctor. We can further analyse the society factors into these following sections: Economic, Health, Safety, Cultural etc. \\

According to updated data from the Canadian government in 2023, the average annual salary for doctors is CAD 233,726.[Pat Link1] Each chest examination requires approximately 15 minutes, while the average waiting time for each chest X-ray is between 1 to 2 days [Pat Link2]. If this technology can reduce the average analysis time to immediate results, it would decrease the analysis cost for each X-ray by about CAD 30. In Canada, there are approximately 20 million X-ray examinations conducted annually [Pat Link 3], with chest X-rays accounting for around 6 to 8 million of those. Based on these calculations, this could save between CAD 160 million and CAD 240 million. \\

At the same time, automated data classification can be utilized in emergency situations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare system was severely overloaded, and there was a widespread shortage of doctors and nurses [Pat link 4]. If this technology can be employed to assist in classifying X-rays during the COVID-19 period, it would significantly increase efficiency and alleviate the burden on the healthcare system, while also helping more patients. This would enable the multifaceted benefits that come with technological advancements to be realized. \\

When evaluating the safety implications of using AI for disease diagnosis, two primary perspectives emerge. On one hand, AI can significantly speed up the diagnostic process, enabling patients to receive treatment more quickly, which is generally expected to have a positive impact. On the other hand, the accuracy of AI-generated diagnoses can be uncertain, as these models typically provide probabilities rather than definitive conclusions. This uncertainty can lead to potential risks, including ethical concerns and legal disputes, especially if a misdiagnosis occurs as every new technology might bring. [Pat link 5] \\

From a cultural perspective, the deployment of AI for medical diagnostics, such as analyzing chest X-rays, can lead to changes in the way healthcare is perceived and delivered[Pat link 6]. In some cultures, there may be a strong preference for face-to-face consultations with doctors, where personal interaction and trust in human judgment are valued highly. The introduction of AI could challenge these traditions, as patients might need to adjust to relying on technology for initial diagnoses. However, in regions where access to medical professionals is limited, such as remote or underserved areas, AI-based diagnostics could be seen as a valuable and empowering tool, providing a sense of autonomy and timely care [Pat link 6].
