\newline
Dr.Emily is excited about how AI can help with diagnosis, especially with flagging and annotating potential abnormalities and providing help on decision-making, which she hopes to increase her overall working efficiency. However, Dr.Emily values transparency in X-ray results so she wants the AI to offer clear explanation instead of being a "black box" that makes decisions for her. She expects the AI system to integrate smoothly into her existing workflow with an intuitive user interface and not too much technology knowledge required. 

\subsubsection{Patient Persona:}
James is a construction site worker and a father of two who recently took a chest X-ray examination after experiencing consistent shortness of breath. As it takes around one week to get the result, he is anxious that it might be a serious condition and would like to know the results as soon as possible. He’s not familiar with medical imaging technology and doesn't know how would AI help with diagnosis. But he really wants to get an accurate and timely result regarding his health condition.\\
\newline
James hopes that AI can help catch potential abnormalities that might be missed by human errors. Privacy and security are also important to James, and he wants to be sure that his personal medical data is handled confidentially and safely. He doesn't want his personal data shared with unauthorized organizations. 

\subsubsection{Developer Persona:}
Alex is an AI developer with proficiency in pyTorch and Python and has some fundamental knowledge in machine learning. Alex is currently working with Dr. Steve on building and optimizing AI models for medical imaging, focusing specifically on chest X-ray analysis.\\
\newline
Alex is motivated to push the boundaries of AI in healthcare and he hope his contribution can make an impact in people's lives. Alex is primarily responsible for designing, training, and fine-tuning the AI models that support chest X-ray diagnosis. He also works closely with physicians and radiologists to get their feedback and improve the algorithms and interfaces. The main challenge for Alex is to ensure that the AI model produce high-accuracy results and explainable outputs at the same time for transparency.

\subsubsection{Researcher Persona:}
Dr. Steve is a postdoctoral researcher specializing in artificial intelligence and medical diagnostics. He focuses on advancing AI technologies that improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in radiology, particularly for chest X-rays.\\
\newline
His day-to-day work involves working on researches on AI applications in healthcare, collaborating with other academic institutions / medical facilities  to validate AI models in real-world scenarios.

\subsection{Impact Analysis}

The primary benefit of this project lies in the ability to deliver preliminary diagnostic results quickly, thereby enhancing diagnostic efficiency and significantly reducing patient wait times. Moreover, the system’s capability for large-scale data classification can gradually improve the precision of analyses, reduce misdiagnoses, and alleviate the workload on medical professionals. When scaled effectively, this project has the potential to increase productivity within the medical sector, reduce healthcare costs, and accelerate service delivery. Additionally, by leveraging cloud-based deployment, this solution can extend diagnostic support to remote regions, providing preliminary assessments without the immediate need for in-person medical consultations.

\subsubsection{Economic Impact}
According to 2023 data from the Canadian government, the average annual salary for doctors is CAD 233,726 \cite{2}. With each chest X-ray analysis typically taking around 15 minutes and a wait time of 1 to 2 days for results \cite{1}, this AI tool has the potential to reduce analysis time to near-instantaneous levels, cutting costs by approximately CAD 30 per examination. Given that Canada conducts around 20 million X-ray examinations annually, with chest X-rays comprising about 6 to 8 million of these \cite{3}, the potential cost savings range from CAD 160 million to CAD 240 million annually. This economic benefit not only supports more efficient use of healthcare resources but also enables reinvestment into other critical areas of patient care.

\subsubsection{Health and Safety Impact}
From a health and safety perspective, the automated nature of this system can play a critical role in emergency situations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare infrastructure faced unprecedented pressure, with a widespread shortage of medical professionals \cite{4}. In such scenarios, AI-assisted tools like this could be deployed to manage and classify X-ray data, significantly improving processing speed and relieving the burden on healthcare providers. This allows for more patients to receive timely care, which is crucial during high-demand periods.
\newline
However, deploying AI for disease diagnosis involves considerations of accuracy and reliability. AI models, while efficient, produce probabilistic outcomes rather than absolute determinations. This inherent uncertainty can introduce risks, including ethical dilemmas and potential legal challenges, particularly if a misdiagnosis occurs \cite{5}. Thus, while the technology can accelerate diagnosis, integrating human oversight remains essential to mitigate these risks and ensure patient safety.

\subsubsection{Cultural Impact}
The introduction of AI-based diagnostic systems, such as this project, can influence the cultural landscape of healthcare delivery. In some cultures, there is a strong preference for direct consultations with healthcare professionals, where personal interaction and trust in human expertise are preferred. The adoption of AI in these contexts may require a cultural shift as patients adapt to receiving initial assessments through automated systems. However, in regions with limited access to healthcare professionals, such as remote or underserved areas, AI-based diagnostics can be perceived as an empowering tool. It offers a level of autonomy and timely access to healthcare information that was previously unavailable \cite{6}. This dual impact reflects the need to balance technological advancements with cultural sensitivity.

\subsubsection{Overall Societal Impact}
This project, when implemented at scale, has the potential to transform the delivery of healthcare. By reducing analysis time and increasing access to diagnostic support, it addresses critical issues such as the strain on healthcare systems and accessibility of medical services in remote areas. The use of cloud technology further ensures that the system can be deployed across a range of settings, from urban hospitals to rural clinics, providing consistent support regardless of location. As society increasingly embraces digital solutions in healthcare, this project stands to play a significant role in reshaping diagnostic practices, making them faster, more efficient, and more accessible.

\section{General System Description}

  \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{SystemContext.png}
  \caption{Neuralanalyzer's System Context Diagram}
  \label{fig:overall-infra}
\end{figure}



\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Need to ensure that the chest X-ray image is of high resolution. }
\item {Need to ensure that the chest X-ray image is a chest X-ray image, not other types of medical images.}
\item {Need to ensure that the chest X-ray image taken by standard machines. Images with poor lighting, noises or does not follow standard protocols will not be accepted. }
\end{itemize}
\item Program Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item {Detect abnormalities / diseases in the chest X-ray images.}
\item {Classify abnormalities / diseases into specific categories.}
\item {Quantify size / degree / volume of abnormalities.}
\item {Produce report with possible diagnosis and the above information.}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The software is typically used in medical and clinical contexts to support healthcare professionals and physicians to speed up X-ray readings and improve accuracy in diagnosis. It is a safety critical application as failure could lead to delay in treatment, misdiagnosis and potentially severe outcomes for the patient.
\subsection{Behavior Overview}
\begin{figure}[H]

  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{UseCase.png}
  \caption{Use Case Diagram of AI for chest X-ray read}
  \label{fig:use-case-diagram}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-5em} 
\newpage
\subsubsection{Normal Operation}
As observed in the use case diagram, the system begins with user input from either patients or radiologists, who upload chest X-ray images to be analyzed. These images can be stored locally or in the cloud for easy access. Once uploaded, the system processes the images using machine learning algorithms to detect abnormalities, annotate findings, and generate diagnostic reports. These reports include detailed analysis results and suggested diagnostic advice, which radiologists can review, edit, and compare with previous records if needed.The system also enables radiologists to refine patient treatment plans based on the AI-generated insights, ensuring a smooth and accurate workflow from image upload to delivering meaningful medical recommendations.
\subsubsection{Undesired Event Handling}
If an undesired event occurs during the operation of the system, it will transition into an error state. In this state, no further data processing will occur to prevent the possibility of using corrupted or inaccurate information, ensuring the integrity of the user's input. A clear error message will be provided to inform the user about the issue, helping them understand the cause and potentially prevent similar occurrences in future operations. To resume normal functionality, the user will need to restart the process and re-upload their data, ensuring that the undesired event does not impact the final results.

 \item They focus on the operational efficiency of the AI system that improve overall workflow efficiency.
 \item They focus on if the AI system follows regulatory and clinical standards. 
 \end{enumerate}
\subsection{System Constraints}

\subsubsection{Government Regulations}
The system must comply with healthcare regulations and obtain approvals from bodies such as the FDA, adhering to PHIPA and other certifications before deployment. Compliance is critical, as non-compliance could result in legal consequences, fines, or restrictions on operation in certain regions.

\subsubsection{Data Usage Consent}
The system must respect patients' consent for data usage, especially under regulations like PIPEDA in Canada. In some regions, even anonymized data may require explicit patient approval, which can limit available training datasets. Additionally, even anonymized data may fall under these regulations due to the risk of re-identification using advanced techniques. Non-compliance could lead to severe penalties, including fines, lawsuits, or suspension of the service.

\subsubsection{Cultural Sensitivity}
Different regions and cultures may have varying levels of acceptance toward AI in healthcare, which can impact the system's deployment. Some countries may require human oversight for every AI-generated decision. Understanding these differences is crucial for identifying target markets and tailoring the rollout strategy to areas more receptive to AI-driven healthcare solutions.

\subsubsection{Budget Limitations in Hospitals}
The application may face constraints due to limited budgets in some healthcare organizations, requiring it to be affordable and sustainable. This limitation could restrict access to advanced hardware or impact the system's speed and performance. It is vital to ensure the application is lightweight and can leverage available resources from the hosting hospital to ensure functionality.

\subsubsection{Legal Liability}
In cases of misdiagnosis, the application's legal responsibility may vary by region, necessitating protections or disclaimers. Obtaining patient consent and providing clear disclaimers are essential steps to mitigate risks of fines or legal action against the company.

\subsubsection{Compatibility with Older Equipment}
The system may need to integrate with older X-ray machines, work with limited computational resources, or function with restricted internet bandwidth in certain hospitals. These constraints are often non-negotiable due to existing infrastructure, and the system must be designed to function effectively under these conditions. Ensuring compatibility is critical, as the system relies on input from X-ray images to operate effectively.

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description}
Disease prediction via medical imaging continues to be one of the most important aspect of health-care. However, the health-care industry is still slowly catching up with current technology, making disease prediction and prevention processes labour-intensive and inefficient. With a prolong history in operation, countless images has been captured from CT Scanners and X-Ray machines, for medical and health-care research, but yet to be applied in hospital settings between physicians and patients.
\newline
Our team, Neuralanalyzer, saw an opportunity to transform traditional health-care processes, by applying Machine Learning, and modern software engineering techniques; aiming to provide an optimized, unified, and HIPAA-compliant platform to predict diseases from chest X-Ray scans.
\newpage
\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\noindent Given the inputs and the constraints of the system, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_prediction_accuracy}:] \textbf{High Prediction Accuracy: }Machine Learning Model used by Neuralanalyzer must have a high prediction accuracy for Chest X-Ray images. We are aiming for a minimum of 75\% accuracy.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_ease_of_ML_intro}:] \textbf{Simple to introduce more ML models: }New classifier models must be simple and intuitive to be integrated with the system, with short time-to-market. This goal will require a containerized ML-plugin code template (in Python) and guidelines documentations for new models to follow.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_fault-tolerance}:] \textbf{High Fault-Tolerance: }Neuralanalyzer's system (front-end, back-end, ML-plugins) must handle run-time errors as clever as possible, to prevents run-time crashes, and unwanted downtime. Comprehensive unit and integration testings must be present, to reduce errors and bugs within the system.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_good_UI}:] \textbf{Intuitive UI/UX: }Neuralanalyzer's front-end must be user-friendly and straight-forward to be used. Front-end's core features such as login, account registration, and image-prediction should require as few clicks as possible.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_dev_work_automation}:] \textbf{High automation of Dev-workflow: }Repetitive, and crucial development workflows must be implemented within Github Actions. Example including: Unit \& Integration Testing, Linting Check, Docker Image build, Deployment on AWS.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_avaialblity}:] \textbf{High Availability: }Neuralanalyzer application must be highly available, with very minimal downtime. Our team aiming to have our targeted SLA as 99\%.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_data_security}:] \textbf{Secure Data Transfer \& Hosting: }Image-related operations, such as storing, transferring via front-end, ML-training must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted. This requires an introduction of a authentication service, which our team will be using AWS Cognito.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Architectural Decision Records}
\begin{itemize}
\item ADR\refstepcounter{adrnum}\theadrnum \label{ADR_AWS_for_prod}: Usage of Amazon Web Services.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rationale}: Our team has chosen to go with the popular AWS platform to host Neuralanalyzer.
        \item \textbf{Benefits}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AWS is HIPPA compliance, making our application hosted on AWS HIPAA-compliance by default.
            \item AWS is a mature platform with large catalog of services, and support from both the AWS team, and the community around it.
            \item Team Members are familiar with AWS, making the development velocity straght-forward, and speedy.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Drawbacks}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item AWS can get expensive if not being utilized correctly.
            \item Some functionalities (such as Authentication on AWS Cognito) are AWS-native, which encourage vendor-locked, and will require developer effort to move off AWS later on. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item ADR\refstepcounter{adrnum}\theadrnum \label{ADR_splitting_AI_from_backend}: Splitting up the ML-Models from the core Neuralanalyzer back-end service.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rationale}: Since the Machine Learning Models only serve the purpose of classifying, we refactored the models out as it's own services, allowing the back-end to handle authentication, and logic coordination.
        \item \textbf{Benefits}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Allowing separate development and deployment of AI-Models, and other application logic (authentication, databases, etc.)
            \item Enabling the ability to connect multiple models, via plugins, onto the system, providing Neuralanalyzer with more flexibility.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Drawbacks}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Increase complexity in managing source code, and at run-time. For example: runtime security, availability, service discovery, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item ADR\refstepcounter{adrnum}\theadrnum \label{ADR_train_on_cas}: Training Neuralanalyzer ML Model on CAS Department's servers.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rationale}: Training ML Models can be costly, through a quick calculation, training our in-house ML Model on AWS (with the lowest settings) for 10 hours can cost minimum of 150 dollars. For research and development purposes, we decided to kick-start the training process on CAS's Department servers.
        \item \textbf{Benefits}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Massively speeds up research and development since department's servers are already set-up with student's MacID.
            \item Reducing cost for AI-Model training.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Drawbacks}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This separate training process makes this particular development workflow hard and time-consuming to automate.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item ADR\refstepcounter{adrnum}\theadrnum \label{ADR_torchxray_as_backup}: Including TorchXRayVision as a back-up model.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Rationale}: To negating the risk of our in-house ML Models not working as expected, using a stable open-source project to back up the core-functionality of the application can drastically improve the fault-tolerance of the system.
        \item \textbf{Benefits}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ability to quickly create a working and stable MVP, which contains the front-end, back-end, and the ML model.
            \item Ability to apply transfer-learning on to this model to fine-tune its accuracy.
            \item Ability to change the source code of this model to fit's our team's need.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Drawbacks}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Un-ability to re-train the model.
            \item Out-of-the-box model has low accuraccy score.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints} 
From our math formulation of the machine learning plugin, the input data will be in a form of an image binary, of size 224x224 pixels. The image being passed in into the ML model will be automatically transformed into gray-scale. Example below:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{chest-x-ray.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Properties of a Correct Solution} \label{sec_CorrectSolution}
In the context of our machine learning model, the absolute correct solution can not be calculated at run-time. However, A solution is considered good enough when during in the training and validation process, the error rate of the system has been reduced to an agreeable number before bringing it to production.
\newpage
\subsection{Assumptions and Relevant Facts}
\subsubsection{Legal and Regulatory Facts} \label{sec_legal}
This project must comply with critical legal and regulatory standards to ensure the secure handling of medical data and the development of software classified as a medical device. In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates strict protections for handling Personal Health Information (PHI), with non-compliance potentially resulting in fines of up to \$1.5 million per violation \cite{10}. Similarly, in Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) governs the handling of personal data in commercial activities, with possible penalties reaching up to CAD 100,000 for non-compliance \cite{2}. For cloud-based storage solutions like those provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), adherence to their shared responsibility model is necessary, where AWS ensures the security of the cloud infrastructure while users manage the security of their data within the cloud \cite{7}. Additionally, the project must adhere to ISO 13485 standards for medical device software, which ensure quality management and regulatory compliance throughout the development and testing phases \cite{8}. Using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard also ensures compatibility with Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), facilitating standardized exchange and storage of medical imaging data \cite{9}.
\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}
\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] ML Models validation process will have to be \textbf{publicly published and accepted by all stakeholders} after being developed. The reason is that the accuracy of the ML model is vital for the safety of the patient, as well as the success of the project. Therefore, this validation method needs to be transparent to all stakeholders and users.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] AWS will share the responsibility with Neuralanalyzer to protect the customer PHI in a law-compliant manner, as mentioned in this \href{https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-risk-and-compliance/shared-responsibility-model.html}{shared-responsibility blog post}.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] McMaster Department's servers will be available for our group members to perform model training and development. Under another assumption that our group members, as users of department resources, must follow department guidelines.

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] It is assumed that the training data set used for model development will include diverse and representative samples to ensure the model’s robustness and generalization across different populations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}
\subsection{Formal Mathematical Specification}

\subsubsection{Formal Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let \( X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\} \) be the set of chest X-ray images, where \( x_i \) represents each individual image.
  \item Let \( Y = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\} \) be the set of labels, where \( y_i \in \{0, 1\} \). Here, \( y_i = 1 \) indicates the presence of a disease, and \( y_i = 0 \) indicates its absence.
  \item Let \( M \) be the machine learning model used for disease detection.
  \item Let \( \theta \) represent the parameters of model \( M \), which are learned during training.
  \item Let \( P(x_i) \) represent the probability that an image \( x_i \) is classified as containing a disease by the model \( M \).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Formal Expressions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Training the Model:}
    \begin{align*}
      \theta^* &= \text{arg min}_\theta \sum_{i=1}^n (M(x_i; \theta) - y_i)^2 \\
      &\text{where } M(x_i; \theta) \text{ is the predicted value for } x_i.
    \end{align*}
    The model parameters \( \theta \) are adjusted during training to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual labels.

  \item \textbf{Prediction:}
    \begin{align*}
      \hat{y}_i &= \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } P(x_i) \geq 0.85 \\
        0 & \text{if } P(x_i) < 0.85
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    The model predicts \( \hat{y}_i = 1 \) (disease present) if the probability \( P(x_i) \) is greater than or equal to 0.85, and \( \hat{y}_i = 0 \) (disease absent) otherwise.

  \item \textbf{Evaluation:}
    \begin{align*}
      \text{Accuracy} &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i = y_i)}{n} \\
      &\text{where } \mathbb{I}(\hat{y}_i = y_i) \text{ equals 1 if the prediction is correct, otherwise 0.}
    \end{align*}
    Accuracy measures the proportion of images for which the model's predictions match the actual labels.

  \item \textbf{Loss Function:}
    \begin{align*}
      L(\theta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n (M(x_i; \theta) - y_i)^2
    \end{align*}
    The loss function measures how far the model's predictions are from the actual labels. The model aims to minimize this function during training.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Model Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The model \( M \) should achieve an accuracy of at least 85\% on the validation dataset.
  \item Each input image \( x_i \) should be preprocessed to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) to ensure compatibility with the model.
  \item The model should be trained on a diverse dataset that includes images from different demographics and disease categories.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? \\\\
We felt the SRS document provided us strong growth and structures as the content was comprehensive. We were able to gain a better understanding of the necessary elements like the scope, context diagrams, and nonfunctional requirements such as performance and safety. The clear delineation between normal operations and undesired event handling gave us confidence in its thoroughness. Overall, we felt that the SRS document provided us with a solid foundation to work from, especially in terms of its clarity, organization, and attention to detail. It gave us a clear picture of the system's requirements and made it easier to move forward with design and implementation.


  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them? \\

When writing the Software Requirements Specification document caused us few challenges that hindered our process. One common issue we faced was the ambiguity in the requirements this can create confusion for our team. We also felt that some things had incomplete requirements, as some aspects were overlooked or not thoroughly explored. Additionally, failing to gather input from all stakeholders, such as clients, end-users, and developers, can result in missing critical features or misunderstanding the true needs of the project. We resolved these pain points by talking with the teaching assistants of this course, whom of which helped us immensely.  


  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)? \\
  
Many of our requirements came from us asking healthcare professionals as well as our supervisor. There was a big emphasises on the need for accuracy, reliability, and a user-friendly interface. These discussions helped shape key requirements, such as incorporating a robust AI model for detecting lung diseases, ensuring transparency in how the AI reaches its conclusions, and making the system accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
      
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project. \\

  By taking courses such as Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI), and previous taken software development will help us substantially. The Machine Learning course has equipped us to gain a better understanding and via taking 4ML3 we can develop an accurate AI model capable of analyzing chest X-rays and identifying potential lung diseases, including knowledge of various algorithms. Meanwhile, as for HCI, the course is teaching us the importance of creating intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that make complex AI results accessible to medical professionals and patients alike. By applying user-centered design principles, we aim to ensure seamless interaction with our system and enhance user trust through transparent communication of AI decisions. All in all, our previous software development courses have further solidified our programming skills and understanding of software architecture, enabling us to effectively integrate these elements into a cohesive application.
  
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice? \\\\

    The following Two quesitons have been answered below: \\\\

\textbf{Assigned Team Members: All} \\
All team members will be required to thoroughly understand the medical conditions and diseases related to chest X-rays that the AI model will be detecting. This knowledge will be acquired through reviewing medical literature, studying annotated chest X-ray datasets, and utilizing any available online medical resources or tutorials that explain chest X-ray interpretation and diagnosis. Every team member will be using all the discussed methods to gain expertise in this domain, as it is essential for everyone to understand the features of different lung conditions (such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or lung cancer). The team will start by studying medical images and datasets, and then further enhance their knowledge by reading research papers and consulting with healthcare professionals to understand how chest X-rays reveal signs of disease.


\textbf{Assigned Team Members: Patrick, Reza, and Kelly} \\
Learning the fundamentals of PyTorch is essential for building AI models to analyze lung X-rays. Our primary focus will be gaining a better understanding of PyTorch's torch tensor data structure. Understanding automatic differentiation through PyTorch's autograd module will allow for efficient backpropagation during model training. Moreover, gaining knowledge on how to handle X-ray images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, will be crucial. This will involve using libraries like \texttt{torchvision} to apply image transformations and \texttt{DataLoader} to manage batching and loading data for training.


\textbf{Assigned Team Members: Ayman} \\
Data Visualization Analysis will require developers to understand users' expected data points, graphic representations, and what types of data need to be compared. Group members are required to have sufficient knowledge of Python data science libraries such as \texttt{Matplotlib}, \texttt{Seaborn}, \texttt{NumPy}, and \texttt{pandas} to create informative graphics and present accurate information to users efficiently. Ayman will be using online tutorials and documentation to gain expertise in data visualization and data analysis to find the most effective way to analyze the logs from the Game Engine and AI Agent.

\subsection*{13.4 Web Creation}

\textbf{Assigned Team Members: Nathan} \\
The Angular Frontend Development will require developers to design and implement a user-friendly interface for our web application. The team will focus on creating a responsive and efficient UI that meets users' needs by ensuring optimal performance and accessibility. The frontend should effectively interact with the backend API for data retrieval and submission, enabling smooth integration of user interactions with the underlying server logic.

This requires sufficient knowledge of Angular, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. They must be proficient in Angular components, directives, services, routing, and form validation to build dynamic, modular, and maintainable applications. The team will utilize Angular Material or Bootstrap for UI components to create visually appealing and responsive designs.


\textbf{Assigned Team Members: All} \\
The main component of the AI model for chest X-ray analysis centers around comprehending the user’s expectations. Healthcare professionals, including radiologists, pulmonologists, and general practitioners, will be the main users of this application since they will need to use the tool for diagnosing lung diseases. Therefore, it is critical to gain an understanding of users and their information needs when designing the AI model and its interface, with the intention of providing relevant information that is precise and adequate.

Furthermore, our application would be helpful for end-users, including junior doctors in medical school, who can use the application as an educational tool or supplemental diagnostic aid. Determining which users will be the target audience and their expectations will inform design choices ranging from how complex the expected output is to how user-friendly the user-interface design is. Everyone is expected to partake in user research, where they will seek feedback from potential end-users and consult healthcare professionals to ensure the tool caters to the specific needs of users from different disciplines. The team will also consider designs that may be more attractive to patients, such as picture-based diagnostic aids or X-ray interpretation rather than a plethora of diagnostic radiology information. This will involve creating a proper compromise between providing detailed diagnostic and analytical information.

  
\end{enumerate}
