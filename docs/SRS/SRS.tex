\plt{This template is intended for use by CAS 741.  For CAS 741 the template
should be used exactly as given, except the Reflection Appendix can be deleted.
For the capstone course it is a source of ideas, but shouldn't be followed

\section{Reference Material}

This section records information for easy reference.

\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.
~\newline

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
%\begin{table}[ht]
  \noindent \begin{tabular}{l l l} 
    \toprule		
    \textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{SI}\\
    \midrule 
    \si{\metre} & length & metre\\
    \si{\kilogram} & mass	& kilogram\\
    \si{\second} & time & second\\
    \si{\celsius} & temperature & centigrade\\
    \si{\joule} & energy & joule\\
    \si{\watt} & power & watt (W = \si{\joule\per\second})\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  %	\caption{Provide a caption}
%\end{table}

\plt{Only include the units that your SRS actually uses.}

\plt{Derived units, like newtons, pascal, etc, should show their derivation
    (the units they are derived from) if their constituent units are in the
    table of units (that is, if the units they are derived from are used in the
    document).  For instance, the derivation of pascals as
    $\si{\pascal}=\si{\newton\per\square\meter}$ is shown if newtons and m are
    both in the table.  The derivations of newtons would not be shown if kg and
    s are not both in the table.}

\plt{The symbol for units named after people use capital letters, but the name
  of the unit itself uses lower case.  For instance, pascals use the symbol Pa,
  watts use the symbol W, teslas use the symbol T, newtons use the symbol N,
  etc.  The one exception to this is degree Celsius.  Details on writing metric
  units can be found on the 
  \href{https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units}
  {NIST} web-page.}

\subsection{Table of Symbols}

The table that follows summarizes the symbols used in this document along with
their units.  The choice of symbols was made to be consistent with the heat
transfer literature and with existing documentation for solar water heating
systems.  The symbols are listed in alphabetical order.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
%\noindent \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{l l X}
\noindent \begin{longtable*}{l l p{12cm}} \toprule
\textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{description}\\

\\
$A_\text{in}$ & \si[per-mode=symbol] {\square\metre} & surface area over 
which heat is transferred in
\\

\end{longtable*}
\plt{Use your problems actual symbols.  The si package is a good idea to use for
  units.}

\subsection{Mathematical Notation}

\plt{This section is optional, but should be included for projects that make use
  of notation to convey mathematical information.  For instance, if typographic
  conventions (like bold face font) are used to distinguish matrices, this
  should be stated here.  If symbols are used to show mathematical operations,
  these should be summarized here.  In some cases the easiest way to summarize
  the notation is to point to a text or other source that explains the
  notation.}

\plt{This section was added to the template because some students use very
  domain specific notation.  This notation will not be readily understandable to
  people outside of your domain.  It should be explained.}

\newpage

\pagenumbering{arabic}

\plt{This SRS template is based on \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007,
  SmithAndKoothoor2016}.  It will get you started.  You should not modify the
  section headings, without first discussing the change with the course
  instructor.  Modification means you are not following the template, which
  loses some of the advantage of a template, especially standardization.
  Although the bits shown below do not include type information, you may need to
  add this information for your problem.  If you are unsure, please can ask the
  instructor.}

\plt{Feel free to change the appearance of the report by modifying the LaTeX
  commands.}

\plt{This template document assumes that a single program is being documented.
  If you are documenting a family of models, you should start with a commonality
  analysis.  A separate template is provided for this.  For program
  families you should look at \cite{Smith2006, SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}.
  Single family member programs are often programs based on a single physical
  model.  General purpose tools are usually documented as a family.  Families of
  physical models also come up.}

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

\plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts
  general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with
a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap''
paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to
expect in the Introduction section.}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

\plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
  on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
  Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
  in the context of the project itself, not in the context of this course.
  Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade, you should not
  mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real project.  The purpose
  section will be similar between projects.  The purpose of the document is the
  purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning for the design stage,
  etc.}

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

\plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
  the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
  for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
  the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
  the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
  actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
  it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
  properties, etc.}  

\plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
  at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
  on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
  describes, all of the assumptions.}

\plt{The scope section is relevant for later determining typical values of inputs. The scope should make it clear what inputs are reasonable to expect. This is a distinction between scope and context (context is a later section).  Scope affects the inputs while context affects how the software will be used.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

\plt{This section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
  SRS.  It does NOT have the same purpose as the ``User Characteristics''
  section (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}).  The intended readers are the
  people that will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that
  will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the
  requirements.  The user, on the other hand, is the person that uses the
  software that is built.  They may never read this SRS document.  Of course,
  the same person could be a ``user'' and an ``intended reader.''}

\plt{The intended reader characteristics should be written as unambiguously and
  as specifically as possible.  Rather than say, the user should have an
  understanding of physics, say what kind of physics and at what level.  For
  instance, is high school physics adequate, or should the reader have had a
  graduate course on advanced quantum mechanics?}

\subsection{Organization of Document}

\plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
  reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
  select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
  be similar between project.}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  \plt{This text can likely be
  borrowed verbatim.}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilities should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
  floating point number
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\plt{Identify in what context the software will typically be used.  Is it for
exploration? education? engineering work? scientific work?. Identify whether it
will be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications.} \plt{This
additional context information is needed to determine how much effort should be
devoted to the rationale section.  If the application is safety-critical, the
bar is higher.  This is currently less structured, but analogous to, the idea to
the Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) that McSCert uses in their
automotive hazard analyses.}

\wss{The }
\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

\plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
  Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
  requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
  different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
  Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
  user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
  end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
  Calculus and Physics.''}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
  limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
  included if they are truly required.}

\section{Specific System Description}
This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.

\subsection{Problem Description}
Disease prediction via medical imaging continues to be one of the most important aspect of health-care. However, the health-care industry is still slowly catching up with current technology, making disease prediction and prevention processes labour-intensive and inefficient. With a prolong history in operation, countless images has been captured from CT Scanners and X-Ray machines, for medical and health-care research, but yet to be applied in hospital settings between physicians and patients.

Our team, Neuralanalyzer, saw an opportunity to transform traditional health-care processes, by applying Machine Learning, and modern software engineering techniques; aiming to provide an optimized, unified, and HIPAA-compliant platform to predict diseases from chest X-Ray scans.
\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Containerized Application}: A portable version of an application that can be run on a container run-time, such as Docker.
\item \textbf{PHI}: Personal Health Information - Private and confidential data that must be protected under the HIPPA act.
\item \textbf{HIPPA}: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a set of standards protecting sensitive health information from disclosure without patient's consent.
\item \textbf{AWS - Amazon Web Services}: A public cloud provider, offering all HIPAA-compliance cloud services that helps Neuralanalyzer host, manage, and scale our application.
\item \textbf{AWS ECS}: AWS Elastic Cloud Service: - An AWS managed service for managing and maintaining application containers at run-time.
\item \textbf{AWS ECR}: AWS Elastic Container Registry - An AWS managed service for storing and managing container images.
\item \textbf{AWS Fargate}: An AWS managed service for running containerized applications.
\item \textbf{AWS Cognito}: An AWS managed service for authentication logic, handling user and password management.
\item \textbf{React}: A web front-end framework, written in Javascript.
\item \textbf{Flask}: An HTTP-based server framework, written in Python.
\item \textbf{ML}: Shorten for Machine Learning.
\item \textbf{TorchXRayVision}: An open-source classifier model that can classify diseases based on chest X-Ray images. \href{https://github.com/mlmed/torchxrayvision}{Github Link}
\item \textbf{SLA}: Shorten for Service-Level Agreement. A percentage metrics to signify the overall up-time of a system. For example, an SLA of 99\% means the system must be up 99\% of it's operational time.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}
\noindent Given the inputs and the constraints of the system, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_prediction_accuracy}:] \textbf{High Prediction Accuracy: }Machine Learning Model used by Neuralanalyzer must have a high prediction accuracy for Chest X-Ray images. We are aiming for a minimum of 75\% accuracy.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_ease_of_ML_intro}:] \textbf{Simple to introduce more ML models: }New classifier models must be simple and intuitive to be integrated with the system, with short time-to-market. This goal will require a containerized ML-plugin code template (in Python) and guidelines documentations for new models to follow.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_fault-tolerance}:] \textbf{High Fault-Tolerance: }Neuralanalyzer's system (front-end, back-end, ML-plugins) must handle run-time errors as clever as possible, to prevents run-time crashes, and unwanted downtime. Comprehensive unit and integration testings must be present, to reduce errors and bugs within the system.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_good_UI}:] \textbf{Intuitive UI/UX: }Neuralanalyzer's front-end must be user-friendly and straight-forward to be used. Front-end's core features such as login, account registration, and image-prediction should require as few clicks as possible.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_dev_work_automation}:] \textbf{High automation of Dev-workflow: }Repetitive, and crucial development workflows must be implemented within Github Actions. Example including: Unit \& Integration Testing, Linting Check, Docker Image build, Deployment on AWS.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_avaialblity}:] \textbf{High Availability: }Neuralanalyzer application must be highly available, with very minimal downtime. Our team aiming to have our targeted SLA as 99\%.
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_data_security}:] \textbf{Secure Data Transfer \& Hosting: }Image-related operations, such as storing, transferring via front-end, ML-training must be authenticated, authorized, and encrypted. This requires an introduction of a authentication service, which our team will be using AWS Cognito.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}
\subsubsection{Architectural Decisions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A. Splitting up the AI-Models from the core Neuralanalyzer back-end service.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Allowing separate development and deployment of AI-Models, and other application logic (authentication, databases, etc.)
            \item Enabling the ability to connect multiple models, via plugins, onto the system, providing Neuralanalyzer with more flexibility.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Drawbacks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Increase complexity in managing source code, and at run-time. For example: runtime security, availability, service discovery, etc.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
\item B. Training Neuralanalyzer ML Model on CAS Department's servers.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Massively speeds up research and development since department's servers are already set-up with student's MacID.
            \item Reducing cost for AI-Model training.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Drawbacks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This separate training process makes this particular development workflow hard and time-consuming to automate.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
\item C. Including TorchXRayVision as a back-up model.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Benefits:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Ability to quickly create a working and stable MVP, which contains the front-end, back-end, and the ML model.
            \item Ability to apply transfer-learning on to this model to fine-tune its accuracy.
            \item Ability to change the source code of this model to fit's our team's need.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Drawbacks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Un-ability to re-train the model.
            \item Out-of-the-box model has low accuraccy score.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}
\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] Machine Learning Models Performance will be tracked via a standardized method, and this method will be publicly published after being developed. Reason being the accuracy of the ML model is vital for the end-user (physicians, patients), therefore this validation method needs transparency to the stakeholders, and users.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] All health-related data that are not publicly available, needs to be handled in a HIPPA-compliance manner. Reason being private PHI are sensitive are are protected under this act.
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:] McMaster Department's servers will be available for our group members to perform model training and development. Under another assumption that our group members, as users of department resources must follows department's guidelines.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints} 
From the system perspective, the input data can be any image, of any size, in any format. Our system will only output the correct label for images of chest x-ray scan. Example below.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{chest-x-ray.png}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Properties of a Correct Solution} \label{sec_CorrectSolution}
In the context of our machine learning model, the absolute correct solution can not be calculated at run-time. However, A solution is considered "good enough" when during in the training and validation process,  the error rate of the system has been reduced to an agreeable number.

\section{Required Behaviour Overview}
Neuralanalyzer's system is composed of 3 main sub-systems:

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\section{Development Plan}

\plt{This section is optional.  It is used to explain the plan for developing
  the software.  In particular, this section gives a list of the order in which
  the requirements will be implemented.  In the context of a course  this is
  where you can indicate which requirements will be implemented as part of the
  course, and which will be ``faked'' as future work.  This section can be
  organized as a prioritized list of requirements, or it could should the
  requirements that will be implemented for ``phase 1'', ``phase 2'', etc.}

\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}

\plt{Show the values of the symbolic parameters introduced in the report.}

\plt{The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.}

\plt{The value of FRACTION, for the Maintainability NFR would be given here.}

\noindent \plt{The following is not part of the template, just some things to consider
  when filing in the template.}

\noindent \plt{Grammar, flow and \LaTeX advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Mac users \texttt{*.DS\_Store} should be in \texttt{.gitignore}
\item \LaTeX{} and formatting rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables are italic, everything else not, includes subscripts (link to
  document)
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf}{Conventions}
\item Watch out for implied multiplication
\end{itemize}
\item Use BibTeX
\item Use cross-referencing
\end{itemize}
\item Grammar and writing rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Acronyms expanded on first usage (not just in table of acronyms)
\item ``In order to'' should be ``to''
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
\begin{itemize}
\item Difference between physical and software constraints
\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not
  a restating of the requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem).
  If you have a table of output constraints, then these are properties of a
  correct solution.
\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
  reference by fields as automatically generatable
\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your
  requirement could be more abstract
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  


\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
