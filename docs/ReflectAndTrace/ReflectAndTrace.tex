\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
feedback.  Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is and
important part of the reflection exercise.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian
Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based
on your reflections.}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}

\plt{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.  Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the course instructor.}

\subsection{Extras}

\plt{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
it led to.}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
 separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your 
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could 
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to 
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an 
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential 
users currently exist?}

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] We closely followed our scheduled meeting plan, holding weekly stand-ups and additional ad hoc meetings during key development phases (Rev0, Rev1,Final Demonstration). These meetings helped us stay aligned and adapt quickly when challenges arose. 
    \item[-] Our primary communication tools(Discord and GitHub) were used effectively for both asynchronous updates and collaborative debugging. We maintained clear version control and documentation throughout development. 
    \item[-] Roles and responsibilities as outlined in our development plan were largely adhered to. Each member focused on their assigned modules (e.g., frontend UI, model training, backend integration), and we successfully coordinated via our Git branching workflow and task tracking system (GitHub issues).
    \item[-] We used the technologies originally proposed in our plan, including Python, PyTorch, React JS. The only deviation was adopting a Detection Transformer model(DETR) earlier than planned due to its proven effectiveness in localization tasks during our initial model experimentation. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What Went Well?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] Discord and GitHub Discussions helped streamline both quick check-ins and in-depth technical discussions. Clear communication reduced misunderstandings and sped up decision-making.
    \item[-] Each member had a clearly defined role (e.g., frontend, model dev, backend), which minimized overlap and improved accountability. Tasks were assigned and tracked using GitHub Issues and Project Boards.
    \item[-] Weekly meetings kept everyone aligned, and sprint planning ensured we had clear short-term goals. Checkpoints during development helped catch issues early.
    \item[-] Our planned technologies (PyTorch, Python, React JS) integrated well with each other. Version control via Github was used effectively for collaboration and rollback when needed.
    \item[-] Independent module development (e.g., AI model, UI, API) allowed parallel progress without bottlenecks. CI/CD setup helped with automated testing and smooth deployment.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] Some tasks, particularly around localized disease progression tracking, took significantly longer than expected. This affected sprint timelines and required scope adjustments mid-way.
    \item[-] Our original plan didn’t account for debugging, model tuning iterations, or integration testing delays. This compressed our final testing and documentation phases.
    \item[-] Early-stage code and design decisions weren’t always documented consistently, leading to rework during integration. We improved this mid-project by enforcing clearer commit messages and README updates.
    \item[-] Adopting DETR introduced additional complexity (e.g., custom training routines, evaluation metrics), which required more experimentation and adaptation than anticipated.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] Allocate extra time in the schedule for unexpected delays, model tuning, and integration/debugging.
    \item[-] Build a rough end-to-end prototype early to identify integration pain points sooner, even before full model training is complete.
    \item[-] Maintain consistent documentation practices from the start, including API specs, model details, and configuration notes, to reduce confusion later.
    \item[-] Involve test users (or at least team cross-reviews) earlier in the UI development cycle to catch usability issues before final sprint.
    \item[-] Identify high-risk components (e.g., novel model architectures) up front and create extra plans or fallback options.
\end{enumerate}
